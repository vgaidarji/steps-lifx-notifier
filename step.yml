title: LIFX Notifier
summary: |-
    Sends signals to your LIFX bulb during builds.
description: |-
    Add this step to your workflow when color change is required.

    This step can be used at the start (notify build start) and at the end (notify success/failure) of your workflow.
    If there's no need to notify about workflow start than adding step to the end of the workflow will be enough.

    If all colors fields will be empty, default colors will be used:
    "build start" - yellow, "build success" - green, "build failure" - red.
